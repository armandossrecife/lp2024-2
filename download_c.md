**Downloading a File Using HTTP in C**

To download a file using HTTP in C, we'll leverage the [libcurl](https://curl.se/libcurl/) library, based on [CURL](https://curl.se/). This library provides a powerful and flexible interface for transferring data using various protocols, including HTTP.

**Here's a basic example:**

```c
#include <curl/curl.h>

int main(void) {
    CURL *curl;
    CURLcode res;

    curl = curl_easy_init();
    if(curl) {
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/file.zip");
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEDATA, fopen("file.zip", "wb"));

        res = curl_easy_perform(curl);

        /* Check for errors */
        if(res != CURLE_OK)
            fprintf(stderr, "curl_easy_perform() failed: %s\n",
                    curl_easy_strerror(res));

        /* always cleanup */
        curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize cURL:**
   - `curl_easy_init()` initializes a cURL easy handle.
2. **Set URL:**
   - `curl_easy_setopt()` sets the URL of the file to download.
3. **Set Write Function:**
   - `curl_easy_setopt()` sets the write function to `fopen("file.zip", "wb")`. This opens a file named "file.zip" in write-binary mode and specifies it as the destination for the downloaded data.
4. **Perform the Download:**
   - `curl_easy_perform()` initiates the download.
5. **Check for Errors:**
   - `curl_easy_strerror()` provides a human-readable error message if the download fails.
6. **Cleanup:**
   - `curl_easy_cleanup()` releases the resources associated with the cURL handle.

**Key Points:**

- **Error Handling:** The code checks for errors using `curl_easy_perform()` and provides an error message if necessary.
- **File Output:** The downloaded data is written directly to the specified file using `fopen`.
- **Library Installation:** Ensure you have the `libcurl` library installed and linked to your C project.
- **Advanced Usage:** `libcurl` offers many more options for customizing downloads, such as setting timeouts, proxies, user authentication, and more. Refer to the `libcurl` documentation for detailed information.

By following these steps and leveraging the powerful features of `libcurl`, you can efficiently download files using HTTP in your C applications.
